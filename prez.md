# Who is this guy?

- Brian Chirls
- NYC, US
- Knight Technolgy Fellow @ POV Digital
- Does code, understands stories
- Likes audiences, tolerates creators
- Web everything (almost)

---

# Conventions and Patterns
- Orient the audience
- Shorthand
- Show, don't tell (where possible)

???

Show, don't tell:
- ways to connect emotionally, not just intellectually
- allows us to skip the explanation.
- don't have to say, "okay, this scene is at a different place now"
- also shouldn't have to say, "click here to make stuff happen"
- takes time for users
- presentation vs. representation?

---

# Conventions in traditional film
- Montage
- Establishing shots
- 180 degree rule
- Exegetic vs. diagetic sound
- Traditional story structure

---

# Interactive video needs new conventions
- **Not TV on the web**
- see: early days of film
- see: web graphic design c. 1995

???

Some trends starting to show up, but are they good?

---

# Convention vs. Cliche
- Is it well researched or the first option?
- Shortcut vs. shorthand
- Relying on originality?

???

- How important to the experience is the originality of the technique?

# Examples...

???

examples of trends

Citizen Kane
- Rosebud
- nobody hears him say it
- huge flaw
- still an amazing film

---

# "FOMO Video"
- "Fear of Missing Out"
- back and forth between multiple simultaneous views
- keyboard or mouse to switch

???

# Examples
- Empire Interactive
- [Honda Ad](https://www.youtube.com/user/HondaVideo)

## FOMO: "The Other Side"
- Essential to the story
- Two paths are almost identical, so you don't really miss anything
- Are people *really* gonna go through it multiple times to catch everything?
- Needs to be a good enough experience the first time through

---

# Popcorn-style (a.k.a. "Pop Up Video")
- Interactive bits pop up while video is playing
  - images
  - wall of text
  - maps
  - more video
- Interrupts flow, distracting
- Too many things to see at once

???

- You would never compose a frame of film this way
- Nor would you edit a film sequence this way
- alternate between

---

# Interactive Map
- Good overview of available options
- Is location relevant to story?
- Does it give a sense of how to proceed?

???

Will come back to this one

---

# Data Firehose
- Twitter. ugh.
- Is it relevant or are you just trying to prove it's live?
- What happens when the data stops coming?

---

# How can we do better?

???

Reference other types of experience
- Video games
- Traditional Films
- Theme Parks
- Museums

Always keep context in mind

ask who plays video games?

---

# Context
- Location: home? office? mobile? theater? installation?
- Equipment: browser (many tabs)? VR Headset?
- Time and attention span

???

Adapt complexity and length to likely scenario
DO NOT assume dedicated attention

# The Attention Problem

???

Sleep No More vs. Fuerza Bruta
- also in VR
- "movie" vs museum
- theme park: dark ride, followed by wandering around (gift shop)

# The Interface Problem

???

Video games
- start out with one crappy weapon
- build up over time
- earn each new ability
- integrated into story

---

# The Navigation Problem

???
- which direction to start? getting lost up-front
- start with narrow space, one direction
- space can curve, hide next step around corners
- widen space, narrow side-paths to explore
- allow back-tracking later on
- broaden to 2-D space when at least the 3rd "location" has been visited
- add side missions, but introduce them as part of main story
